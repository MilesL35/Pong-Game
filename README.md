# Pong-Game
### Description
A simple Pong game I made to learn C++ graphics on Windows.
### Secifications
It only works on Windows.\
When editing in Visual Studio exclude every file from the build except the win32_platform.cpp.\
You will also need to go to your project propeties/linker/system and change the subSystem to Windows.\
